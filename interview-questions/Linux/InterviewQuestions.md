# Question 1:

#### There are five users in your Linux Machine. One user is running a script that is causing 100% CPU Utilization. What would you do?

1. ​**Identify the Problematic User/Process**​:
   * Use system monitoring tools like `top`, `htop`, or `ps` to identify which user's process is consuming the most CPU resources.
   * Once you've identified the user and the specific process causing the high CPU utilization, you can proceed to address the issue.
2. ​**Analyze the Script/Process**​:
   * Determine the nature of the script or process causing the high CPU usage. Is it a legitimate task or a malfunctioning script?
   * Review the script's code or examine the process to understand its purpose and resource requirements.
3. ​**Notify the User**​:
   * Contact the user responsible for the script or process causing the high CPU utilization.
   * Inform them about the issue and request that they take appropriate action to reduce the CPU load.
